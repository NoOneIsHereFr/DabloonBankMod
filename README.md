#### Features:

- a back button in every Menu

  I know that it is Anoying so I added them
  to prevent any person to destroy
  his device with a apple o the Backside
  
- a Backup/Restore Feature

  Good If you Actually destroyed your
  device with a apple on the backside

- no max adding amount

  Saw someone giving you 101 Dabloons
  and you couldn't add them so I did this

- Custom ATM Card (you can add your own soon)

  Nothing to explain here ig?

- Storing Dabloons as QR Code

  you lost your device with a apple on the backside?
  with this Feature you wont lose your Dabloons
