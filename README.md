## Features:

- a back button in every Menu

  I know that it is annoying so I added them
  to prevent any person to destroy
  their device with a apple on the backside
  
- a Backup/Restore Feature

  Good If you Actually destroyed your
  device with a apple on the backside

- no max adding amount

  Saw someone giving you 101 Dabloons
  and you couldn't add them? Now you can

- Custom ATM Card (you can add your own)

  Nothing to explain here ig?

- Some Bug fixes
  
  Also nothing to expain  

- Storing Dabloons as QR Code

  you lost your device with a apple on the backside?
  with this Feature you wont lose your Dabloons


## Tutorial

Step 3: You have it on your ShareSheet so you can sadly watch TikTok and get Dabloons. Have Fun Traveller
